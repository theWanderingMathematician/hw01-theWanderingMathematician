Once upon a time, people travelled all over the world, and some stayed in hotels and others chose to stay in other people's houses that they booked through Airbnb.
Recent developments in Edinburgh regarding the growth of Airbnb and its impact on the housing market means a better understanding of the Airbnb listings is needed.
Using data provided by Airbnb, we can explore how Airbnb availability and prices vary by neighbourhood.

# Getting started

[Go to Homework]((https://github.com/dsci-151-spr24/hw01))

Then make your own copy of this by clicking on `Use this template`:

```{r git-template, fig.fullwidth=TRUE, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/repo-template.png")
```

Grab the URL of the repo, and clone it in RStudio.
Refer to Lab 01 if you would like to see step-by-step instructions for cloning a repo into an RStudio project.

First, open the R Markdown document `hw-01-airbnb-edi.Rmd` and Knit it.
Make sure it compiles without errors.
The output will be in the file markdown `.md` file with the same name.

## Warm up

Before we introduce the data, let's warm up with some simple exercises.

-   Update the YAML, changing the author name to your name, and **knit** the document.
-   Commit your changes with a meaningful commit message.
-   Push your changes to GitHub.
-   Go to your repo on GitHub and confirm that your changes are visible in your Rmd **and** md files. If anything is missing, commit and push again.

## Packages

We'll use the **tidyverse** package for much of the data wrangling and visualisation and the data lives in the **dsbox** package.
These packages are already installed for you.
You can load them by running the following in your Console:

```{r load-packages, message = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(dsbox)
```

## Data

The data can be found in the **dsbox** package, and it's called `edibnb`.
Since the dataset is distributed with the package, we don't need to load it separately; it becomes available to us when we load the package.

You can view the dataset as a spreadsheet using the `View()` function.
Note that you should not put this function in your R Markdown document, but instead type it directly in the Console, as it pops open a new window (and the concept of popping open a window in a static document doesn't really make sense...).
When you run this in the console, you'll see the following **data viewer** window pop up.

```{r view-data}
View(edibnb)
```

You can find out more about the dataset by inspecting its documentation, which you can access by running `?edibnb` in the Console or using the Help menu in RStudio to search for `edibnb`.
You can also find this information [here](https://rstudio-education.github.io/dsbox/reference/edibnb.html).

# Exercises

```{marginfigure}
**Hint:** The Markdown Quick Reference sheet has an example of inline R code that might be helpful. You can access it from the Help menu in RStudio.
```

1.  How many observations (rows) does the dataset have? Instead of hard coding the number in your answer, use inline code.

-   *There are `r nrow(dsbox::edibnb)` observations in the `edibnb` dataset.*

2.  Run `View(edibnb)` in your Console to view the data in the data viewer. What does each row in the dataset represent?

-   *Each row in the dataset represents a single airbnb.*

üß∂ ‚úÖ ‚¨ÜÔ∏è *Knit,* *commit, and push your changes to GitHub with an appropriate commit message. Make sure to commit and push all changed files so that your Git pane is cleared up afterwards.*

Each column represents a variable.
We can get a list of the variables in the data frame using the `names()` function.

```{r}
names(edibnb)
```

You can find descriptions of each of the variables in the help file for the dataset, which you can access by running `?edibnb` in your Console.

```{marginfigure}
**Note:** The plot will give a warning about some observations with non-finite values for price being removed. Don't worry about the warning, it simply means that 199 listings in the data didn't have prices available, so they can't be plotted.
```

3.  Create a faceted histogram where each facet represents a neighbourhood and displays the distribution of Airbnb prices in that neighbourhood. Think critically about whether it makes more sense to stack the facets on top of each other in a column, lay them out in a row, or wrap them around. Along with your visualisation, include your reasoning for the layout you chose for your facets.

```{r}
ggplot(data = edibnb, mapping = aes(x = price)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 25) +
  facet_wrap(~ neighbourhood, ncol = 1)
```

- *I have chose a vertically-stacked format to represent this data, because if the data is stacked vertically, we can see the price distribution in each neighbourhood and compare them to eachother more easily along the price axis, so that we can see which neighbourhood has more airbnbs within certain price ranges. For example, if someone wanted an airbnb between 250 and 500GBP per night, they could see what neighbourhoods have more within what parts of that price range (at least, assuming that the graph were rendered with enough vertical room for all the facets, unlike the image viewer in rstudio is doing right now).*

Let's de-construct this code:

-   `ggplot()` is the function we are using to build our plot, in layers.
-   In the first layer we always define the data frame as the first argument. Then, we define the mappings between the variables in the dataset and the **aes**thetics of the plot (e.g. x and y coordinates, colours, etc.).
-   In the next layer we represent the data with **geom**etric shapes, in this case with a histogram. You should decide what makes a reasonable bin width for the histogram by trying out a few options.
-   In the final layer we facet the data by neighbourhood.

üß∂ ‚úÖ ‚¨ÜÔ∏è Knit, *commit, and push your changes to GitHub with an appropriate commit message. Make sure to commit and push all changed files so that your Git pane is cleared up afterwards.*

4.  Use a single pipeline to identity the neighbourhoods with the top five median listing prices. Then, in another pipeline filter the data for these five neighbourhoods and make ridge plots of the distributions of listing prices in these five neighbourhoods. In a third pipeline calculate the minimum, mean, median, standard deviation, IQR, and maximum listing price in each of these neighbourhoods. Use the visualisation and the summary statistics to describe the distribution of listing prices in the neighbourhoods. (Your answer will include three pipelines, one of which ends in a visualisation, and a narrative.)

```{r}
edibnb_prices <- edibnb[,-c(1,4,5,6,7,8,9,10)] 
edibnb_median <- edibnb_prices %>% 
  filter(!is.na(price) & !is.na(neighbourhood)) %>%
  group_by(neighbourhood) %>%
  summarise_all(.funs = median)

top5median <- edibnb_median %>%
  arrange(-price) %>%
  slice(1:5)
top5median
```
```{r}
edibnb %>%
  filter(neighbourhood == "New Town" | neighbourhood == "Old Town" | neighbourhood == "West End" | neighbourhood == "Stockbridge" | neighbourhood == "Bruntsfield") %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = price, y = neighbourhood, colour = neighbourhood, fill = neighbourhood)) +
    geom_density_ridges(alpha = 0.1) +
    labs(title = "Prices of airbnbs in Edinburgh", subtitle = "arranged by neighbourhood", x = "Price", y = "Neighbourhood", colour = "", fill = "")
```

``` {r}
NeighStats <- edibnb_prices %>% 
  group_by(neighbourhood) %>%
  filter(neighbourhood == "New Town" | neighbourhood == "Old Town" | neighbourhood == "West End" | neighbourhood == "Stockbridge" | neighbourhood == "Bruntsfield") %>%
  filter(!is.na(price)) %>%
  summarise_all(.funs = c(min, median, mean, sd, IQR, max))

names(NeighStats)[2] <- ("min")
names(NeighStats)[3] <- ("median")
names(NeighStats)[4] <- ("mean")
names(NeighStats)[5] <- ("standard_deviation")
names(NeighStats)[6] <- ("IQR")
names(NeighStats)[7] <- ("max")
NeighStats
```

- *From the plotted data, we can see that the distributions of prices fall into two different shapes: the roughly symmetrical (to the point where zero is reached, that is) plots of West End, New Town, and Old Town, and the notably left-skewed plots of Stockbridge and Bruntsfield's distributions, on which the peak is not only skewed, but also more broad on top. The tibble confirms our guess by showing Bruntsfield and Stockbridge as having the lowest medians and means; interestingly, though, they also have the lowest values in all of the categories other than minimum value, having the smallest interquartile range and standard deviation, presumably partially because most of their values are clustered around the central area and the peak itself contains more values, while their tails are lower and end earlier than the others. According to the tibble, Old Town and New Town have the highest standard deviations and means. Could the standard deviations be larger mainly because the means are higher, allowing values to be farther away from them on the smaller side? The differences between their means and minimum values are indeed larger than the other neighbourhoods, but are still smaller than their standard deviations.Also visible on the graph, Old Town and West End have a small jump upwards in numbers at 500GBP, unlike the other three neighbourhoods.*

5.  Create a visualization that will help you compare the distribution of review scores (`review_scores_rating`) across neighbourhoods. You get to decide what type of visualisation to create and there is more than one correct answer! In your answer, include a brief interpretation of how Airbnb guests rate properties in general and how the neighbourhoods compare to each other in terms of their ratings.

```{r}
edibnb %>%
  mutate(review_scores_modified = (review_scores_rating*number_of_reviews + 100)/(number_of_reviews + 2)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = review_scores_modified, y = neighbourhood, colour = neighbourhood, fill = neighbourhood)) +
  geom_density_ridges(alpha = 0.1) +
  labs(title = "Ratings of airbnbs in Edinburgh", subtitle = "By neighbourhood", x = "Review score", y = "")

edibnb %>%
  mutate(review_scores_modified = (review_scores_rating*number_of_reviews + 100)/(number_of_reviews + 2)) %>%
  mutate(price_to_score = 100*price/ review_scores_modified) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = price_to_score, y = neighbourhood, colour = neighbourhood, fill = neighbourhood)) +
  geom_density_ridges(alpha = 0.1) +
  labs(title = "Qualitative prices of airbnbs", subtitle = "By neighbourhood", x = "Price modulated by rating", y = "") +
  xlim(0, 1000) 
```

- *The first chart here shows the ratings of airbnbs in different neighbourhoods in Edinburgh, with the ratings modified according to the rule of succession (meaning that I calculated the review score if there were two more ratings: one at 0, and one at 100), so that the ratings are more likely to be indicative of the true nature of the quality, and (for example) an airbnb with a single 100% rating wouldn't be listed higher than one with a hundred reviews, averaging to 95%. Looking at the modes of each distribution, we see that New Town has the highest-valued peak, just ahead of Leith, Cannonmills, Old Town, and Southside. Southside's own mode slides down towards the lower end of the distribution, being much more right-skewed than the others.*
- *The second plot here is a similar distribution, but this time the x-axis is price multiplied by the modified rating, producing what I call an "affordability score" or the "qualitative price", meaning that two airbnbs with the same prices but with different ratings will show up in different places; an airbnb with a score of 50 will have its qualitative price doubled, while one with a score of 80 will have its score multiplied by 1.25. In this plot, Bruntsfield, Haymarket, and Morningside appear to have the lowest modes, thereby appearing as the cheapest per quality of the airbnbs. However, a numerical analysis of that data (similar to the above analysis of actual price) would be required to fully determine the cheapest per quality.*
